## Languages
Schmendrick's Weaponry will be implemented with **Java 23** due to the following:
- Java is a widely used, strongly typed, object-oriented language.
- It provides long-term stability, performance, and an extensive ecosystem of libraries.
- Everyone in our group is at least proficient in Java.

## Frameworks
We will be using **Spring Boot** as our framework, as it is the industry standard for pairing with Java and helps to streamline the development process.
- It is widely used and well-supported in the Java ecosystem
- It works seamlessly with Maven and modern Java versions

## Data Storage Plan
We plan to use JSON as our storage method, as it is lightweight, flexible, and easy to integrate.
- It is human-readable format that is simple to work with
- It is language-independent and widely supported
