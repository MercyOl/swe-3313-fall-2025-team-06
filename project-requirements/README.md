## Written Requirements
#### To minimize any confusion about the scope of our project, we created a comprehensive list of written requirements. You can find them [here](written-requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md).

## Use Case Diagram
#### To better envision the different use cases of our product, we created a use case diagram which can be found [here](https://github.com/MercyOl/swe-3313-fall-2025-team-06/blob/main/project-requirements/use-case.md).

## Decision Table
#### To lay out the rules and actions that affect client interaction, we created a decision table and a coded prototype of the decision table, found [here](https://github.com/MercyOl/swe-3313-fall-2025-team-06/blob/main/project-requirements/decision-table.md).
